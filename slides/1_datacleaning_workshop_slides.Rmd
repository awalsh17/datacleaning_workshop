## Introduction to part 1

As the saying goes, data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data... and the other 20% complaining about data cleaning. 


In this workshop, participants will learn how to use R packages to ingest, clean, and reshape data.

## What we are doing

- We will introduce useful R packages and learned wisdom on how to approach data wrangling in general
- We will take on a series of challenges 
- We will discuss the various solutions that were arrived at by different participants 
- We will discuss how to ask coding questions effectively 

## The data value chain

## Useful packages

+ tidyverse: readr, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, purrr
+ janitor
+ skimr
+ DataExplorer


## Getting the @#$@! Data into R

What if the raw data cannot even get into R?

## Let's take on some challenges

Instructions and background on the data

1. Ingest rectangular data - readr vs. base R vs. data.table
2. Inspect the data - dplyr, skimr, DataExplorer
3. Fix some dirty fields - dplyr, tidyr, janitor
4. Ingest other data - JSON
5. Reshaping data - what is tidy data?
6. Pivoting - tidyr::gather(), tidyr::spread()
7. Pivoting - new tidyr `pivot_` functions


## Time to share

## How to ask better questions

## Getting the @#$@! Data into R

1. Best case scenario - Rds file

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mydata <- readRDS('mydata.Rds')
```

## Getting the @#$@! Data into R

2. Still good scenario - flat text file (csv, tab-delimited)

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mydata <- read.csv('mydata.csv')
```



Variations on base R read.csv():

+ `readr::read_csv()` 
+ `data.table::fread()`

## Getting the @#$@! Data into R

### What's the difference?   

+ stringsAsFactors
+ "bad" column names
+ others?

## Getting the @#$@! Data into R

### Other data sources

+ database (local or remote)
+ JSON
+ xml

### At the end of the day, we usually want a data frame!!

## First challenge - load our data

Dataset source, [opendataphilly](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/farmers-markets-locations/resource/d23195c1-b7ce-4ae0-a81c-51753d096c6f)

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
markets_tidy <- readr::read_csv("../exercises/Philadelphia_Farmers_Markets.csv", )
dim(markets_tidy)

markets_base <- read.csv("../exercises/Philadelphia_Farmers_Markets.csv")
dim(markets_base)
```

## What is different?

Let's use the glimpse function from dplyr
```{r}
glimpse(markets_base)
glimpse(markets_tidy)
```

## What is different?

+ Defaults for read.csv left " ", read_csv converted to "NA"
+ Defaults for read.csv made variables factors, read_csv made character

## Fix any weirdness

+ Column names: read.csv will convert spaces to ".", read_csv will not
+ Coding of missing values: "na.strings" argument to read.csv
+ Data type doesn't match: "stringsAsFactors" argument, type.convert() function
