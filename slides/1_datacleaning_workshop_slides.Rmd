## Introduction to part 1

As the saying goes, data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data... and the other 20% complaining about data cleaning. 


In this workshop, participants will learn how to use R packages to ingest, clean, and reshape data.

## What we are doing

- We will introduce useful R packages and learned wisdom on how to approach data wrangling in general
- We will take on a series of challenges 
- We will discuss the various solutions that were arrived at by different participants 
- We will discuss how to ask coding questions effectively 

## The data value chain

## Useful packages

+ tidyverse: readr, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, purrr
+ janitor
+ skimr
+ DataExplorer (requires later R version)


## Getting the @#$@! Data into R

What if the raw data cannot even get into R?

## What is tidy data?

https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

1. Each variable must have its own column.
1. Each observation must have its own row.
1. Each value must have its own cell.

Usually datasets are organized to make *data entry* easy, but not to make *data analysis* easy.

## Let's take on some challenges

Instructions and background on the data

1. Ingest rectangular data - readr vs. base R vs. data.table
2. Inspect the data - dplyr, skimr, DataExplorer
3. Fix some dirty fields - dplyr, tidyr, janitor
4. Ingest other data - JSON
5. Pivoting - RIP to tidyr::gather(), tidyr::spread()
6. Pivoting - new tidyr `pivot_` functions

## How to ask better questions

a `reprex` is a *repr*oducible *ex*ample.
